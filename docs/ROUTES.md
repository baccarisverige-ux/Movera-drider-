# Driver route inventory

Refreshed for Phase 46. Canonical entry: MoveraApp → DriverHome. Legacy auth is opt-in via MOVERA_ENABLE_LEGACY_AUTH and disabled by default. Demo/local services remain labelled.

## Canonical tasks
- Active trips: Home → AcceptRide → DriverRideCompleted → Home or queued AcceptRide.
- History: RideHistory → detail, with illustrative route map.
- Documents: DriverDocuments → item-specific DocumentPreview (no legacy upload).
- Support: SupportInboxScreen → local conversation draft.
- Reservations: ScheduledRidesScreen → nonbinding preview detail.
- Logout: DriverStarter displays demo account boundary; legacy sign-in is disabled by default.

Phase 45 removed the unreferenced legacy Splash, UploadVehiclePhotos screen, stale `accept ride/components/cancel_ride.dart` helper and unused ReceiverMessage widget. LegalDocumentScreen was initially suspected to be orphaned, but analyzer verification proved it remains reachable from Profile, so it is retained. Remaining orphan candidates are not deleted without new reachability proof. This inventory does not by itself certify runtime navigation behavior.
