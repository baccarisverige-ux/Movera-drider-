# Android permissions

Minimum set for the current Driver frontend:

| Permission | Why it stays |
| --- | --- |
| `INTERNET` | Demo road routing and map tiles |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | When-in-use driver location while the app is open |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` | Coarse fallback for the same when-in-use location |

Camera and document photos use the image picker. That API does not need
`READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` on current target SDKs.
Those legacy storage permissions are not requested.

Denial or cancel of camera, location, or the picker must leave the draft on
screen. It must not crash and must not invent a captured file.
